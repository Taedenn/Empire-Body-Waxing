    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <!-- Question 1 -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">How long does hair need to be?</div>
      <div class="answer">Hair needs to be at least 1/4" in length (grain of rice). Longer is better not a trim time to wax. Do NOT Fret. There is no such thing as "too long" just "too short."</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="question">How long does a wax last?</div>
      <div class="answer">A first-timer can expect new growth every 2. This is due to your human hair growth cycles. All waxable body hair cycles similarly, as your are pulling the hair and the system out of the roots and causing them to reset in the same time. This results in right as hair starts to grow, it's time for your wax! 4 weeks is the sweet spot for most clients.</div>
